Welcome to the docs
---------------------

PyDropsondes is a Python-based interface that interacts with the user to read, process and create stylish output showing the main thermodynamic
and dynamic metrics derived from dropsonde measurements.

.. note::
   This is the documentation provided by the `Sphinx Python <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. module, extended with the
   `Sphinx Gallery <http://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
   This page provides a detailed account of the scripts used in the Project by three main tools:
            1. An index (bellow) and diagram (:ref:`userguide`) showing how different scripts, modules and functions interconnect and feed from each other.
            2. A module by module and function by function in-line documentation of all the code. Refer to index if you get lost or looking to some particular snippet.
            3. An example gallery (:ref:`gallery`), where you can find examples of possible plots using the Dropsonde Dataset.
